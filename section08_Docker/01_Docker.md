## **1. Introduction to Docker on AWS**  

### **Understanding Virtual Machines vs. Containers**  
In the previous lectures, we primarily worked with virtual machines (VMs) to deploy applications on AWS. However, in this section, we will transition to using **Docker containers** to streamline deployment and resource management.  

**Virtual Machines on AWS:**  
- AWS provides virtualized environments using the **Xen hypervisor** (historically) or **KVM hypervisor** (more recently for some instances).  
- A physical server (managed by AWS) runs a **host operating system**, which supports multiple **guest operating systems**.  
- Each guest OS includes binaries, libraries, and applications, creating full-fledged **virtual machines (VMs)**.  
- When you SSH into an EC2 instance, you're accessing the guest OS, running inside a VM.  

**Containers on AWS:**  
- Instead of running full guest OS environments, **Docker containers** share the **same host OS kernel** but remain isolated from one another.  
- The **Docker Engine** enables running multiple containers on a single host OS.  
- Unlike VMs, **containers do not require a hypervisor or a separate OS per application**, reducing overhead and improving startup times.  

**Limitations of Running Containers Directly on AWS:**  
- AWS does **not** allow direct container execution on physical hosts for security reasons.  
- Instead, AWS provisions an **EC2 instance**, where you install Docker Engine to manage containers.  
- For a managed approach, AWS provides **Elastic Container Service (ECS)** and **Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** to simplify container orchestration.

## **2. Why Use Docker on AWS?**  

Docker offers several advantages when deploying applications on AWS:  

1. **Faster Deployment:**  
   - Containers start in **milliseconds**, compared to the minutes required for VM booting.  
2. **Efficient Resource Utilization:**  
   - Multiple containers can share the same host OS, leading to lower resource consumption than running separate VMs.  
3. **Portability:**  
   - Docker images ensure that applications behave consistently across different environments.  
4. **Scalability:**  
   - With **Amazon ECS or Kubernetes (EKS)**, containers can be **easily scaled horizontally** without provisioning additional VMs manually.  
5. **Simplified CI/CD Pipelines:**  
   - Tools like **Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and AWS CodeBuild** can integrate with Docker for automated image building and deployment.  

**Comparison: Virtual Machines vs. Containers on AWS**  

| Feature               | Virtual Machines (VMs) | Containers (Docker) |
|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Boot Time            | Minutes              | Milliseconds      |
| Resource Efficiency  | High Overhead (Guest OS per VM) | Lightweight (Shared Host OS) |
| Isolation            | Full OS per VM       | Process-level Isolation |
| Portability         | Limited to hypervisor environments | Portable across platforms |
| Scalability         | Slower, requires new VM provisioning | Rapid scaling with ECS/EKS |

## **3. Building and Deploying Docker Images on AWS**  
![Building Docker Images](image.png)

### **Building Docker Images**  
To deploy applications in Docker containers, we start by creating a **Docker image**. This is done using a **Dockerfile**, which defines:  
- The **base image** (e.g., `ubuntu`, `node`, `python`).  
- Required dependencies (binaries, libraries).  
- The application code and startup command.  

Example **Dockerfile**:  
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
### **Steps to Deploy a Docker Image on AWS:**  

1. **Build the Docker Image**  
   ```sh
   docker build -t my-app .
   ```  

2. **Push the Image to a Docker Repository (Amazon ECR)**  
   - First, authenticate Docker with ECR:  
     ```sh
     aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
     ```
   - Create an ECR repository:  
     ```sh
     aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-app
     ```
   - Tag and push the image:  
     ```sh
     docker tag my-app:latest <account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest
     docker push <account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest
     ```

3. **Deploy the Image Using Amazon ECS**  
   - AWS ECS **automatically pulls images from ECR** and runs them on EC2 instances or AWS Fargate (serverless).  
   - Terraform can be used to define ECS clusters, tasks, and services for automated deployments.

## **4. Automating Docker Deployments with Terraform**  

Terraform simplifies infrastructure provisioning and ensures repeatable deployments. Here's how we define an **ECS cluster with Terraform**:

### **Terraform Configuration for ECS Cluster**
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "my_cluster" {
  name = "my-cluster"
}

resource "aws_ecs_task_definition" "my_task" {
  family                   = "my-task"
  container_definitions    = jsonencode([
    {
      name      = "my-container",
      image     = "<account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest",
      memory    = 512,
      cpu       = 256,
      essential = true,
    }
  ])
}

resource "aws_ecs_service" "my_service" {
  name            = "my-service"
  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.my_cluster.id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.my_task.arn
  desired_count   = 2
}
```

### **Deploying with Terraform**  
```sh
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

This will:  
- Create an **ECS cluster** named `my-cluster`.  
- Define a **task** running the Docker container from ECR.  
- Launch **two instances** of the container in an ECS service.

## **5. Local vs. Production Environments**  

| Use Case | Tool |
|----------|------|
| **Production Deployment** | Terraform + Amazon ECS + ECR |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | Jenkins + Terraform |
| **Local Development** | Docker Compose |

For local development, **Docker Compose** allows running multi-container applications:

Example **docker-compose.yml**:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: my-app
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      - DEBUG=True
```
Run it with:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

## **6. Summary and Next Steps**  

- **Docker simplifies application deployment** by eliminating VM overhead.  
- **AWS ECS/ECR integrate seamlessly with Terraform** for automated container orchestration.  
- **Terraform enables infrastructure as code**, making deployments repeatable and manageable.  
- **Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and AWS CodeBuild** can automate image building and deployment.  
- **Next:** Hands-on deployment of ECS with Terraform.  

By following these principles, you can **efficiently manage containerized applications on AWS** using Terraform, Docker, and CI/CD automation. ðŸš€
