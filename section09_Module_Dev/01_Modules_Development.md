# Terraform Module Development  

## Resources:  
- [Terraform AWS Modules Repository](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules) â€“ Community-maintained Terraform modules for AWS  
- [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) â€“ The official Terraform module registry where you can find modules for AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more  
- [Terraform Module Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules) â€“ HashiCorpâ€™s official documentation on writing and using Terraform modules  

## Introduction to Terraform Modules  

In the next couple of lectures, we will explore **Terraform Module Development**, a fundamental concept in Infrastructure as Code (IaC).  

### What are Terraform Modules?  
Terraform **modules** are a powerful way to encapsulate and reuse infrastructure code, making deployments more **scalable, maintainable, and modular**. They can be classified into:  

1. **External Modules** â€“ Prebuilt modules from **Terraform's community or official sources**  
2. **Custom Modules** â€“ User-defined modules tailored to specific infrastructure needs  

By leveraging modules, you can efficiently manage and standardize infrastructure deployments.

## External Terraform Modules  

Instead of writing everything from scratch, you can use **predefined modules** from Terraformâ€™s community or official sources. These modules **abstract complex infrastructure setups** and provide a **consistent way to provision resources**.  

One of the most well-known repositories is:  
ðŸ‘‰ **[GitHub: Terraform AWS Modules](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules)**  

This repository contains **community-maintained AWS modules** that are regularly updated and improved. The modules available here are categorized based on their maintainers:  

1. **Community-maintained modules** â€“ Developed and supported by the Terraform community  
2. **Official HashiCorp modules** â€“ Developed and maintained by HashiCorp itself  

### Examples of Popular AWS Modules  

| Module | Purpose |  
|--------|---------|  
| **terraform-aws-vpc** | Creates VPC resources (subnets, route tables, etc.) |  
| **terraform-aws-alb** | Sets up an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** for traffic distribution |  
| **terraform-aws-eks** | Deploys a **Kubernetes Cluster** on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) |  

Using these modules eliminates the need to manually configure these services, allowing you to focus on customizing infrastructure rather than starting from scratch.

## Why Write Custom Modules?  

While **external modules** offer convenience, **custom modules** provide:  

âœ… **Full Flexibility** â€“ You can define resources exactly as needed  
âœ… **Reusability** â€“ If stored in a **Git repository**, the module can be used across multiple projects  
âœ… **Standardization** â€“ Ensures consistent deployment patterns across environments  

For example, if an organization has multiple AWS environments (dev, staging, prod), a **custom module** can define standardized networking, security, and scaling configurations for all environments.

## Upcoming Demo: ECS with an ALB  

In the next demonstration, we will build a **custom Terraform module** for **AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)** integrated with an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.  

The process will include:  
1. **High-level overview** â€“ Understanding module structure, inputs, and outputs  
2. **Deep dive** â€“ Step-by-step breakdown of creating the module  

By the end of this demo, you will learn:  
ðŸ”¹ How to structure a **Terraform module**  
ðŸ”¹ How to define **variables, outputs, and resource blocks**  
ðŸ”¹ How to reuse the module across multiple environments  

This hands-on session will help you master **modular infrastructure as code**, a crucial skill for scaling Terraform deployments effectively.
