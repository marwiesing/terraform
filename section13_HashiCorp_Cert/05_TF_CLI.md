# **Using the Terraform Command Line Interface (CLI)**  

## **Official Resources**  
To ensure you have the latest information, I recommend checking out the **official Terraform CLI documentation**:  
- 📌 **[Terraform CLI Commands](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands)** – A complete reference for Terraform commands.  
- 📌 **[Terraform Workspaces](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/workspaces)** – Details on Terraform workspaces and their limitations.  
- 📌 **[Terraform Debugging](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/logging)** – Guide to debugging Terraform issues.

## **Introduction to Terraform CLI Commands**  ![CLI](image.png)

While `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` are the most commonly used Terraform commands, the certification requires knowledge of additional commands. This section summarizes important Terraform CLI commands beyond the basics.

---

## **1. Formatting Terraform Code (`terraform fmt`)**  

### **What it does:**  
- **Formats Terraform configuration files (`.tf` files) according to best practices**.  
- Ensures **consistent indentation and alignment** for readability and maintainability.  

### **Usage Example:**  
```sh
terraform fmt
```
- This command formats all `.tf` files in the current directory.  

```sh
terraform fmt main.tf
```
- This formats only the `main.tf` file.  

### **Why it matters:**  
✅ Ensures **consistent coding style** across teams.  
✅ Improves **readability** and **maintainability** of Terraform code.  
✅ Should be **run before committing code** to version control.  

---

## **2. Marking a Resource for Recreation (`terraform taint`)**  

### **What it does:**  
- Marks a **specific resource** as “tainted,” which forces Terraform to **destroy and recreate** it on the next `terraform apply`.  

### **Usage Example:**  
```sh
terraform taint aws_instance.myinstance
```
- Marks the `aws_instance.myinstance` resource for recreation.  

```sh
terraform apply
```
- Terraform **destroys and recreates** the tainted resource.  

### **Why it matters:**  
✅ Useful when a resource is **misconfigured** and needs to be replaced.  
✅ Helps in **forcing updates** to certain infrastructure components.  
❌ **Deprecation Note:** Terraform **1.0+** replaced `terraform taint` with `terraform apply -replace`.  

#### **Modern Alternative (`terraform apply -replace`)**
```sh
terraform apply -replace="aws_instance.myinstance"
```
This command **directly replaces** the resource without requiring `terraform taint`.  

---

## **3. Importing Existing Resources (`terraform import`)**  

### **What it does:**  
- Imports existing infrastructure into Terraform **state**, allowing Terraform to manage it **without recreating** it.  
- **Does NOT generate `.tf` configuration files**—you must write them manually.  

### **Usage Example:**  
```sh
terraform import aws_instance.myinstance i-0abcdef1234567890
```
- Imports an **AWS EC2 instance** into Terraform state.  
- The first argument (`aws_instance.myinstance`) is the **Terraform resource name**.  
- The second argument (`i-0abcdef1234567890`) is the **real-world AWS resource ID**.  

### **Why it matters:**  
✅ Allows you to **bring existing infrastructure under Terraform management**.  
✅ Helps in **migrating manually created resources into Terraform**.  
✅ Requires **manual `.tf` file creation** before running `terraform import`.  

---

## **4. Managing Workspaces (`terraform workspace`)**  

### **What it does:**  
- Terraform **workspaces** allow **isolated state files** within the same backend.  
- Each workspace has its **own separate Terraform state**.  

### **Usage Examples:**  
#### **Create a new workspace:**
```sh
terraform workspace new test
```
- Creates a new workspace named `test` and automatically switches to it.  

#### **List available workspaces:**
```sh
terraform workspace list
```
- Displays the currently available workspaces.  

#### **Switch between workspaces:**
```sh
terraform workspace select default
```
- Switches back to the `default` workspace.  

### **Why it matters:**  
✅ Allows **temporary environments** for testing changes.  
✅ Useful for **sandboxing experiments** before modifying production infrastructure.  
❌ **Limitations:** Workspaces **do not provide full isolation**—they share the same backend.  

---

## **5. Managing Terraform State (`terraform state`)**  

### **What it does:**  
- `terraform state` lets you **manipulate and inspect Terraform’s state file**.  
- You can **list, move, remove, or modify** state entries.  

### **Usage Examples:**  
#### **List all resources in the state file:**
```sh
terraform state list
```

#### **Show details of a specific resource:**
```sh
terraform state show aws_instance.myinstance
```

#### **Move a resource to a new name:**
```sh
terraform state mv aws_instance.old_name aws_instance.new_name
```

#### **Remove a resource from the state (without deleting it from the cloud):**
```sh
terraform state rm aws_instance.myinstance
```

### **Why it matters:**  
✅ Helps in **managing state-related issues** (e.g., renaming or removing resources).  
✅ Essential for **state migration and cleanups**.  
✅ Used when **Terraform loses track of a resource** and needs manual intervention.

## **6. Debugging Terraform Issues (`TF_LOG`)**  

### **What it does:**  
- Enables **detailed logging** for troubleshooting Terraform issues.  
- **Valid log levels:**  
  - `TRACE` → Most detailed debugging.  
  - `DEBUG` → Standard debugging logs.  
  - `INFO` → Normal execution information.  
  - `WARN` → Warnings about potential issues.  
  - `ERROR` → Only logs errors.  

### **Usage Examples:**  
#### **Enable debugging on Linux/macOS:**  
```sh
TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform apply
```

#### **Enable debugging on Windows PowerShell:**  
```sh
$Env:TF_LOG = "DEBUG"
terraform apply
```

#### **Redirect logs to a file:**  
```sh
TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform apply > terraform.log 2>&1
```
- This stores **debug logs in `terraform.log`** for later analysis.  

### **Why it matters:**  
✅ Helps **diagnose issues when Terraform hangs or errors occur**.  
✅ Provides **detailed execution information** for debugging.  
✅ Useful when working with **complex dependencies or backend issues**.

## **Key Takeaways**  

✅ **`terraform fmt`** → Formats Terraform code for consistency.  
✅ **`terraform taint` (deprecated, use `-replace`)** → Forces resource recreation.  
✅ **`terraform import`** → Imports existing resources into Terraform state.  
✅ **`terraform workspace`** → Manages isolated state environments (limited isolation).  
✅ **`terraform state`** → Inspects and manipulates Terraform state.  
✅ **`TF_LOG`** → Enables detailed Terraform debugging.  

For **real-world Terraform projects**, always:  
- **Use remote state storage** (e.g., S3, Terraform Cloud) for team collaboration.  
- **Use reusable modules** instead of workspaces for multi-environment deployments.  
- **Enable version control (Git) and CI/CD for infrastructure changes**.
