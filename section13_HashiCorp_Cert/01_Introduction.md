# **Introduction to HashiCorp Terraform Associate Certification**

## **Official Resources**
Before diving into the objectives of the HashiCorp Terraform Associate Certification, I recommend checking the official HashiCorp certification page:  
[HashiCorp Certifications](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification)  
From there, you can navigate to the **Terraform Associate** certification, where you will find the latest exam objectives, requirements, and preparation resources. This ensures that you are always aligned with the most up-to-date certification content.

## **Course Overview and Exam Preparation**

### **Narrator:**  
In this section, we will cover key topics that will help you prepare for the **HashiCorp Terraform Associate Certification**. 

While this course already provides a solid foundation in Terraform, this section is specifically tailored to align with the **official HashiCorp certification objectives**. My goal is to explain these objectives in a way that makes them easy to understand and apply in real-world scenarios.

I will go over each objective, filling in any gaps where necessary to ensure you are fully prepared for the exam. This means that if HashiCorp expects you to understand certain concepts in depth, we will take the time to explore them thoroughly in the upcoming lectures.

## **Understanding the Exam Objectives**

To get an overview of the certification and its requirements, visit the [Terraform Associate Certification page](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate). Here, you will find the **latest exam objectives**, including the core competencies that you need to master before taking the exam.

Itâ€™s important to note that **HashiCorp frequently updates its certification requirements**. The objectives, number of sections, and content covered in the exam can change over time. Therefore, I strongly recommend periodically reviewing the certification page to stay updated.

Currently, the exam is structured into nine sections (subject to change). Each section covers specific Terraform concepts, ranging from **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** to **managing state, working with modules, provisioning infrastructure, and security best practices**.

For example, in the **next lecture**, we will focus on **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**â€”explaining what it is, why it's beneficial, and how Terraform implements it in practice.

## **Keeping the Course Updated**
I am committed to ensuring that this course remains **aligned with the latest Terraform Associate certification objectives**. If HashiCorp introduces new topics or modifies existing ones, I will update the course accordingly.

However, if you notice that a particular concept mentioned in the certification objectives is missing from this course, feel free to **send me a message**. I will review it and, if necessary, incorporate it into future lessons to ensure comprehensive coverage.
