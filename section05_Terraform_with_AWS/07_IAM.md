## **Introduction to AWS IAM**
IAM (Identity & Access Management) is a fundamental AWS service that enables secure control over access to AWS resources. IAM allows the creation and management of **users, groups, and roles**, which can be assigned permissions to interact with AWS services securely.

### **Key IAM Components**
1. **Users:** Individual identities that can authenticate using a username and password or API keys.
2. **Groups:** A way to manage multiple users with shared permissions.
3. **Roles:** Temporary permissions that can be assumed by users, services, or applications.
4. **Policies:** JSON-based rules that define permissions.
5. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Adds an extra layer of security for users.

---

## **IAM Users and Groups**
### **Creating an IAM User**
IAM users can be assigned to groups and given permissions via policies. Authentication can be done using:
- A **login and password** (for the AWS Management Console)
- **Access Key ID and Secret Access Key** (for AWS CLI, SDKs, and APIs)
- **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** (recommended for security)

### **Example: IAM Users and Groups**
Consider an organization where we need to provide **administrator access** to certain users.

#### **Step 1: Creating an Administrators Group**
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_group" "administrators" {
  name = "administrators"
}
```

#### **Step 2: Attaching Administrator Access Policy**
AWS provides predefined **Managed Policies** that we can attach to users or groups. The `AdministratorAccess` policy grants full permissions to AWS.

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_policy_attachment" "administrators-attach" {
  name       = "administrators-attach"
  groups     = [aws_iam_group.administrators.name]
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess"
}
```

#### **Step 3: Creating Users and Assigning Them to Groups**
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_user" "admin1" {
  name = "admin1"
}

resource "aws_iam_user" "admin2" {
  name = "admin2"
}

resource "aws_iam_group_membership" "administrators-users" {
  name  = "administrators-users"
  users = [aws_iam_user.admin1.name, aws_iam_user.admin2.name]
  group = aws_iam_group.administrators.name
}
```
### **Best Practices for IAM Users**
âœ… **Use groups for permissions** instead of assigning policies directly to users.  
âœ… **Enable MFA** for all users with console access.  
âœ… **Rotate credentials regularly** for users with API access.  

---

## **IAM Roles and Policies**
Unlike IAM users, **IAM roles** provide temporary access credentials. This is particularly useful for:
- **EC2 instances accessing S3, DynamoDB, etc.**
- **AWS Lambda functions executing API calls**
- **Cross-account access without sharing credentials**

### **Example: IAM Role for S3 Bucket Access**
Suppose we want to grant an **EC2 instance** permission to read and write to an S3 bucket named `mybucket`.

#### **Step 1: Create the IAM Role**
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role" "s3_mybucket_role" {
  name = "s3-mybucket-role"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Action    = "sts:AssumeRole"
      Effect    = "Allow"
      Principal = {
        Service = "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }]
  })
}
```
ðŸ’¡ **Key point:** The `sts:AssumeRole` action allows the role to be assumed by an EC2 instance.

#### **Step 2: Create an IAM Instance Profile**
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_instance_profile" "s3_mybucket_role_instanceprofile" {
  name = "s3-mybucket-role-instanceprofile"
  role = aws_iam_role.s3_mybucket_role.name
}
```
ðŸ’¡ **Why do we need an instance profile?**  
An **instance profile** acts as a wrapper around an IAM role. When launching an EC2 instance, AWS requires an **IAM instance profile**, not just a role.

#### **Step 3: Create an IAM Policy for S3 Access**
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "s3_access_policy" {
  name = "s3-access-policy"
  role = aws_iam_role.s3_mybucket_role.name

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Effect   = "Allow"
      Action   = "s3:*"
      Resource = [
        "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*"
      ]
    }]
  })
}
```
ðŸ’¡ **Breakdown of Policy Statement:**
- `"Effect": "Allow"` â†’ Grants permissions.
- `"Action": "s3:*"` â†’ Allows all actions on S3.
- `"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*"` â†’ Applies to all objects inside the bucket.

#### **Step 4: Attach Role to an EC2 Instance**
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  iam_instance_profile = aws_iam_instance_profile.s3_mybucket_role_instanceprofile.name
}
```
---

## **How IAM Roles Work in Practice**
1. When the EC2 instance starts, it retrieves temporary credentials via the **Instance Metadata Service**.
2. The instance uses these credentials to authenticate with AWS services like S3.
3. The AWS SDK automatically refreshes the credentials before expiration.

### **Example: Retrieving Credentials on an EC2 Instance**
```bash
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/s3-mybucket-role
```
This returns:
```json
{
  "AccessKeyId": "AKIAEXAMPLE",
  "SecretAccessKey": "secret123",
  "Token": "FQoEXAMPLE",
  "Expiration": "2025-02-07T23:59:59Z"
}
```

## **IAM Best Practices**
âœ… **Follow the principle of least privilege:** Only grant the permissions required for a task.  
âœ… **Enable MFA:** Protect user accounts with two-factor authentication.  
âœ… **Use IAM roles for applications:** Avoid using hardcoded AWS credentials in code.  
âœ… **Rotate credentials frequently:** Ensure regular rotation of API keys.  
âœ… **Monitor IAM activities:** Use AWS CloudTrail to track IAM changes and access logs.

## **Conclusion**
IAM is a crucial AWS service that ensures secure access control. By using **users, groups, roles, and policies**, AWS enables fine-grained permission management.

Next up, we'll demonstrate these concepts in a **live Terraform deployment** where we create IAM roles, attach policies, and launch an EC2 instance that accesses an S3 bucket.

### **IAM Roles Demo Summary**

In this demo, the instructor demonstrates the practical implementation of **IAM roles** in AWS using Terraform. The demo follows the theoretical discussion from the previous section, providing a hands-on approach to setting up an **EC2 instance** with an **IAM role** that grants access to an **S3 bucket**.

---

### **Step 1: Launching the EC2 Instance with an IAM Role**
- The instructor boots up an **EC2 instance** using Terraform.
- The instance is assigned an **IAM role** (`s3-mybucket-role`).
- This role allows the instance to **read and write** objects to an S3 bucket without requiring AWS credentials.
- The necessary **VPC, security groups, and SSH keys** are also created.

---

### **Step 2: Logging into the EC2 Instance**
- After launching the instance, the instructor logs in using SSH.
- If the connection is refused, it may be due to the instance still initializing.
- The public **IP address** of the instance is used for the SSH connection.

---

### **Step 3: Installing AWS CLI**
- The instructor installs the **AWS CLI** on the instance:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-dev
  pip3 install awscli
  ```
- This allows interaction with AWS services directly from the command line.

---

### **Step 4: Uploading a File to S3**
- A simple text file (`test.txt`) is created:
  ```bash
  echo "This is a test file" > test.txt
  ```
- The file is uploaded to the **S3 bucket** using `aws s3 cp`:
  ```bash
  aws s3 cp test.txt s3://mybucket/
  ```
- The upload works **without configuring credentials**, demonstrating that the **IAM role is providing access**.

---

### **Step 5: Verifying IAM Role Credentials**
- AWS **Instance Metadata Service** provides temporary credentials for the IAM role:
  ```bash
  curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/s3-mybucket-role
  ```
- The response contains:
  ```json
  {
    "AccessKeyId": "AKIAEXAMPLE",
    "SecretAccessKey": "secret123",
    "Token": "FQoEXAMPLE",
    "Expiration": "2025-02-07T23:59:59Z"
  }
  ```
- These **temporary credentials** allow the instance to authenticate with AWS services **without manually configuring access keys**.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
âœ… **IAM roles eliminate the need for hardcoded credentials**, reducing security risks.  
âœ… **Temporary security credentials are dynamically generated** and automatically rotated.  
âœ… **AWS CLI and SDKs automatically assume the role**, making authentication seamless.  
âœ… **Roles should be used instead of manually configuring access keys**, as they are **more secure and easier to manage**.

---

### **Terraform Code Overview**
The instructor also provides Terraform configurations that:
- Define the **IAM role** and **instance profile**.
- Attach an **S3 access policy** to the role.
- Launch an **EC2 instance** with the assigned IAM role.
- Create an **S3 bucket**.

This reinforces the theoretical concepts covered earlier, demonstrating how IAM roles **enable secure access to AWS services**.
